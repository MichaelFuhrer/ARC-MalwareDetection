# ECE5900 Spring 2022 - Final Project: Concealed Malware Detection using Adversary Resistant Neural Networks

This repository contains the programming and training approach in an attempt to address the 
security vulnerability introduced by adversarial malware-obfuscation techniques. Within is an 
adversarial neural network with a obfuscator (generator) and detector (discriminator). To train 
I used the EMBER feature set (https://github.com/elastic/ember) to extract features from binaries within the 
SOREL-20M repository (https://github.com/sophos/SOREL-20M). 

Please note that this repository does not contain any  of the SOREL-20M dataset, nor any instances of  malware. 
One would have to install the SOREL20M dataset separately to properly operate this  repository.
In this adversarial setup, the obfuscator will attempt to non-destructively modify the feature set of the malware to increase 
the false negative rate (FNR) of the detector. The detector uses LLE feature reduction, which has been shown to improve adversary resistance.

For more details, please refer to the report PDF in the repository, my video presentation found here: https://youtu.be/TGuli8jA4EA, or send me questions 
at mfuhrer@vt.edu. Thanks!
